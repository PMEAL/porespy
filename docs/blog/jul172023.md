# Introducing the PoreSpy Blog

Github now offers the [Discussions](https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/discussions) tab as a place for making annoucements about PoreSpy, but that forum is a bit limited. It's not really suitable for doing longer walk-throughs on how to do interesting or useful things with PoreSpy. This new blog will probably be used sparingly, but I foresee us using it to demonstrate a new feature that we might add to PoreSpy, or an overview of something we discuss in a journal article. To implement this blog we have chosen to use [Ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), which builds on top of the [sphinx documentation engine](http://sphinx-doc.org/) that we use to build the PoreSpy docs. We were already using the [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to generate the examples in the docs, so are able to leverage that here to write blog posts just by create a Jupyter notebooks.
