def snow(im, r_max=4, sigma=0.4):
    r"""
    This function partitions the void space into pore regions using a
    marker-based watershed algorithm.  The key to this function is that true
    local maximum of the distance transform are found by trimming various
    types of extraneous peaks.

    The SNOW network extraction algorithm (Sub-Network of an Over-segmented
    Watershed) was designed to handle to perculiarities of high porosity
    materials, but it applies well to other materials as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        Can be either (a) a boolean image of the domain, with ``True``
        indicating the pore space and ``False`` elsewhere, or (b) a distance
        transform of the domain calculated externally by the user.  Option (b)
        is faster if a distance transform is already available.

    r_max : scalar
        The radius of there spherical structuring element to use in the Maximum
        filter stage that is used to find peaks.  The default is 4

    sigma : scalar
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian filter used in step 1.  The
        default is 0.4.  If 0 is given then the filter is not applied, which is
        useful if a distance transform is supplied as the ``im`` argument that
        has already been processed.

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple containing several arrays.  This is a **named tuple** meaning that
    each array can be accessed using the following attribute names:

        * ``im``: The binary image of the void space
        * ``dt``: The distance transform of the image
        * ``peaks``: The peaks of the distance transform after applying the
        steps of the SNOW algorithm
        * ``regions``: The void space partitioned into pores using a marker
        based watershed with the peaks found by the SNOW algorithm

def find_peaks(dt, r=4, footprint=None):
    r"""
    Returns all local maxima in the distance transform

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : ND-array
        The distance transform of the pore space.  This may be calculated and
        filtered using any means desired.

    r : scalar
        The size of the structuring element used in the maximum filter.  This
        controls the localness of any maxima. The default is 4 voxels.

    footprint : ND-array
        Specifies the shape of the structuring element used to define the
        neighborhood when looking for peaks.  If none is specified then a
        spherical shape is used (or circular in 2D).

    Returns
    -------
    An ND-array of booleans with ``True`` values at the location of any local
    maxima.

    Notes
    -----
    It is also possible ot the ``peak_local_max`` function from the
    ``skimage.feature`` module as follows:

    ``peaks = peak_local_max(image=dt, min_distance=r, exclude_border=0,
    indices=False)``

    This automatically uses a square structuring element which is significantly
    faster than using a circular or spherical element.

def reduce_peaks_to_points(peaks):

    Any peaks that are broad or elongated are replaced with a single voxel

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : ND-image
        An image containing True values indicating peaks in the distance
        transform

    Returns
    -------
    An array with the same number of isolated peaks as the original image, but
    fewer total voxels.

    Notes
    -----
    The center of mass of a group of voxels is used as the new single voxel, so
    if the group has an odd shape (like a horse shoe), the new voxel may *not*
    lie on top of the original set.

    Removes peaks that were mistakenly identified because they lied on a

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : ND-array
        A boolean image containing True values to mark peaks in the distance
        transform (``dt``)

    dt : ND-array
        The distance transform of the pore space for which the true peaks are
        sought.

    max_iters : int
        The maximum number of iterations to run while eroding the saddle
        points.  The default is 10, which is usually not reached; however,
        a warning is issued if the loop ends prior to removing all saddle

def trim_nearby_peaks(peaks, dt):

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : ND-array
        A boolean image containing True values to mark peaks in the distance

    An array the same size as ``peaks`` containing a subset of the peaks in

    Notes
    -----
    Each pair of peaks is considered simultaneously, so for a triplet of peaks
    each pair is considered.  This ensures that only the single peak that is
    furthest from the solid is kept.  No iteration is required.
