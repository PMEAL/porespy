    r"""
    Applies the SNOW algorithm to each phase indicated in ``phases``.

    This function is a combination of ``snow`` [1]_, ``snow_dual`` [2]_,
    ``snow_n`` [3]_, and ``snow_parallel`` [4]_ from previous versions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phases : ND-image
        An image indicating the phase(s) of interest. A watershed is produced
        for each integer value in ``phases`` (except 0's). These are then
        combined into a single image and one network is extracted using
        ``regions_to_network``.
    phase_alias : dict
        A mapping between integer values in ``phases`` and phase name, used
        to add labels to the network. For instance, asssuming a two-phase
        image, ``{1: 'void', 2: 'solid'}`` will result in the labels
        ``'pore.void'`` and ``'pore.solid'``, as well as
        ``'throat.solid_void'``, ``'throat.solid_solid'``, and
        ``'throat.void_void'``. If not provided, aliases are assumed to be
        ``{1: 'phase1', 2: 'phase2, ...}``.  Phase labels can also be applied
        afterward using ``label_phases``.
    boundary_width : depends
        Number of voxels to add to the beginning and end of each axis. This
        argument is handled the same as ``pad_width`` in the ``np.pad``
        function. A scalar adds the same amount to the beginning and end of
        each axis. ``[A, B]`` adds A to the beginning of each axis and B to the
        ends.  ``[[A, B], ..., [C, D]]`` adds A to the beginning and B to the
        end of the first axis, and so on. The default is to add 3 voxels on
        both ends of all axes.  For each boundary width that is not 0, a label
        will automatically be applied indicating which end of which axis (i.e.
        ``'xmin'`` and ``'xmax'``).
    accuracy : string
        Controls how accurately certain properties are calculated during the
        analysis of regions in the ``regions_to_network`` function.
        Options are:

        'standard' (default)
            Computes the surface areas and perimeters by simply counting
            voxels. This is *much* faster but does not properly account
            for the rough voxelated nature of the surfaces.
        'high'
            Computes surface areas using the marching cube method, and
            perimeters using the fast marching method. These are substantially
            slower but better account for the voxelated nature of the images.

    voxel_size : scalar (default = 1)
        The resolution of the image, expressed as the length of one side of a
        voxel, so the volume of a voxel would be **voxel_size**-cubed.
    parallelization : dict
        The arguments for controlling the parallization of the watershed
        function are rolled into this dictionary, otherwise the function
        signature would become too complex. Refer to the docstring of
        ``snow_partitioning_parallel`` for complete details. If no values
        are provided then the defaults for that function are used.
        To disable parallelization pass ``parallel=None``, which will invoke
        the standard ``snow_partitioning``.

    Returns
    -------
    network : dict or named-tuple
        A *named-tuple* is returned with the padded ``phases`` image, the
        watershed segmentated ``regions``, and the ``network`` dictionary.
