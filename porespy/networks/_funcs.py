def map_to_regions(regions, values):
    r"""
    Maps pore values from a network onto the image from which it was extracted

    Parameters
    ----------
    regions : ndarray
        An image of the pore space partitioned into regions and labeled
    values : array_like
        An array containing the numerical values to insert into each region.
        The value at location *n* will be inserted into the image where
        ``regions`` is *n+1*.  This mismatch is caused by the fact that 0's
        in the ``regions`` image is assumed to be the backgroung phase, while
        pore index 0 is valid.

    Notes
    -----
    This function assumes that the array of pore values are indexed starting
    at location 0, while in the region image 0's indicate background phase and
    the region indexing starts at 1.  That is, region 1 corresponds to pore 0.

def add_boundary_regions(regions, pad_width=3):
    r"""
    Add boundary regions on specified faces of an image

    Parameters
    ----------
    regions : ndarray
        An image containing labelled regions, such as a watershed segmentation
    pad_width : array_like
        Number of layers to add to the beginning and end of each axis. This
        argument is handled similarly to the ``pad_width`` in the ``np.pad``
        function. A scalar adds the same amount to the beginning and end of
        each axis. [A, B] adds A to the beginning of each axis and B to the
        ends.  [[A, B], ..., [C, D]] adds A to the beginning and B to the
        end of the first axis, and so on. The default is to add 3 voxels on
        both ends of each axis.  One exception is is [A, B, C] which A to
        the beginning and end of the first axis, and so on. This extra option
        is useful for putting 0 on some axes (i.e. [3, 0, 0]).
