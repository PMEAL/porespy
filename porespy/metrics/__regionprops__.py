def props_to_DataFrame(regionprops):
    r"""
    Returns a Pandas DataFrame containing all the scalar metrics for each
    region, such as volume, sphericity, and so on, calculated by
    ``regionprops_3D``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regionprops : list
        This is a list of properties for each region that is computed
        by ``regionprops_3D``.  Because ``regionprops_3D`` returns data in
        the same ``list`` format as the ``regionprops`` function in **Skimage**
        you can pass in either.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame : Pandas DataFrame
        A Pandas DataFrame with each region corresponding to a row and each
        column corresponding to a key metric.  All the values for a given
        property (e.g. 'sphericity') can be obtained as
        ``val = df['sphericity']``.  Conversely, all the key metrics for a
        given region can be found with ``df.iloc[1]``.

def prop_to_image(regionprops, shape, prop):
    r"""
    Creates an image with each region colored according the specified ``prop``,
    as obtained by ``regionprops_3d``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regionprops : list
        This is a list of properties for each region that is computed
        by PoreSpy's ``regionprops_3D`` or Skimage's ``regionsprops``.
    shape : array_like
        The shape of the original image for which ``regionprops`` was obtained.
    prop : string
        The region property of interest.  Can be a scalar item such as 'volume'
        in which case the the regions will be colored by their respective
        volumes, or can be an image-type property such as 'border' or
        'convex_image', which will return an image composed of the sub-images.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ND-array
        An ND-image the same size as the original image, with each region
        represented by the values specified in ``prop``.

def regionprops_3D(im):
    r"""
    Calculates various metrics for each labeled region in a 3D image.

    The ``regionsprops`` method in **skimage** is very thorough for 2D images,
    but is a bit limited when it comes to 3D images, so this function aims
    to fill this gap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        An imaging containing at least one labeled region.  If a boolean image
        is received than the ``True`` voxels are treated as a single region
        labeled ``1``.  Regions labeled 0 are ignored in all cases.

    Returns
    -------
    props : list
        An augmented version of the list returned by skimage's ``regionprops``.
        Information, such as ``volume``, can be found for region A using the
        following syntax: ``result[A-1].volume``.

        The returned list contains all the metrics normally returned by
        **skimage.measure.regionprops** plus the following:

        'slices': Slice indices into the image that can be used to extract the
        region

        'volume': Volume of the region in number of voxels.

        'bbox_volume': Volume of the bounding box that contains the region.

        'border': The edges of the region, found as the locations where
        the distance transform is 1.

        'inscribed_sphere': An image containing the largest sphere can can
        fit entirely inside the region.

        'surface_mesh_vertices': Obtained by applying the marching cubes
        algorithm on the region, AFTER first blurring the voxel image.  This
        allows marching cubes more freedom to fit the surface contours. See
        also ``surface_mesh_simplices``

        'surface_mesh_simplices': This accompanies ``surface_mesh_vertices``
        and together they can be used to define the region as a mesh.

        'surface_area': Calculated using the mesh obtained as described above,
        using the ``porespy.metrics.mesh_surface_area`` method.

        'sphericity': Defined as the ratio of the area of a sphere with the
        same volume as the region to the actual surface area of the region.

        'skeleton': The medial axis of the region obtained using the
        ``skeletonize_3D`` method from **skimage**.

        'convex_volume': Same as convex_area, but translated to a more
        meaningful name.

    Notes
    -----
    Regions can be identified using a watershed algorithm, which can be a bit
    tricky to obtain desired results.  *PoreSpy* includes the SNOW algorithm,
    which may be helpful.
