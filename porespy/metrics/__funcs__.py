def representative_elementary_volume(im, npoints=1000):
    r"""
    Calculates the porosity of the image as a function subdomain size.  This
    function extracts a specified number of subdomains of random size, then
    finds their porosity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        The image of the porous material

    npoints : int
        The number of randomly located and sized boxes to sample.  The default
        is 1000.

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple containing the ND-arrays: The subdomain *volume* and its
    *porosity*.  Each of these arrays is ``npoints`` long.  They can be
    conveniently plotted by passing the tuple to matplotlib's ``plot`` function
    using the \* notation: ``plt.plot(*the_tuple, 'b.')``.  The resulting plot
    is similar to the sketch given by Bachmat and Bear [1]

    Notes
    -----
    This function is frustratingly slow.  Profiling indicates that all the time
    is spent on scipy's ``sum`` function which is needed to sum the number of
    void voxels (1's) in each subdomain.

    Also, this function is primed for parallelization since the ``npoints`` are
    calculated independenlty.

def pore_size_density(im, bins=10, voxel_size=1):
    r"""
    Computes the histogram of the distance transform as an estimator of the
    pore sizes in the image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        Either a binary image of the pore space with ``True`` indicating the
        pore phase (or phase of interest), or a pre-calculated distance
        transform which can save time.

    bins : int or array_like
        This number of bins (if int) or the location of the bins (if array).
        This argument is passed directly to Scipy's ``histogram`` function so
        see that docstring for more information.  The default is 10 bins, which
        reduces produces a relatively smooth distribution.

    voxel_size : scalar
        The size of a voxel side in preferred units.  The default is 1, so the
        user can apply the scaling to the returned results after the fact.

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple containing two 1D arrays: ``radius `` is the radius of the voxels,
    and ``count`` is the number of voxels that are within R of the solid.

    Notes
    -----
    This function should not be taken as a pore size distribution in the
    explict sense, but rather an indicator of the sizes in the image.

def porosity(im):
    r"""
    Calculates the porosity of an image assuming 1's are void space and 0's are
    solid phase.  All other values are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        Image of the void space with 1's indicating void space (or True) and
        0's indicating the solid phase (or False).

    Returns
    -------
    porosity : float
        Calculated as the sum of all 1's divided by the sum of all 1's and 0's.

    Notes
    -----
    This function assumes void is represented by 1 and solid by 0, and all
    other values are ignored.  This is useful, for example, for images of
    cylindrical cores, where all voxels outside the core are labelled with 2.

    Alternatively, images can be processed with ``find_disconnected_voxels``
    to get an image of only blind pores.  This can then be added to the orignal
    image such that blind pores have a value of 2, thus allowing the
    calculation of accessible porosity, rather than overall porosity.

    spacing : int
        The space between points on the regular grid that is used to generate

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple containing the x and y data for plotting the two-point correlation

    Notes
    -----
    The brute-force approach means overlaying a grid of equally spaced points
    onto the image, calculating the distance between each and every pair of
    points, then counting the instances where both pairs lie in the void space.

    This approach uses a distance matrix so can consume memory very quickly for
    large 3D image and/or close spacing.
