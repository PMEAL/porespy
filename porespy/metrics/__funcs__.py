def representative_elementary_volume(im, npoints=1000):
    r"""
    Calculates the porosity of the image as a function subdomain size.  This
    function extracts a specified number of subdomains of random size, then
    finds their porosity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        The image of the porous material

    npoints : int
        The number of randomly located and sized boxes to sample.  The default
        is 1000.

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple containing the ND-arrays: The subdomain *volume* and its
    *porosity*.  Each of these arrays is ``npoints`` long.  They can be
    conveniently plotted by passing the tuple to matplotlib's ``plot`` function
    using the \* notation: ``plt.plot(*the_tuple, 'b.')``.  The resulting plot
    is similar to the sketch given by Bachmat and Bear [1]

    Notes
    -----
    This function is frustratingly slow.  Profiling indicates that all the time
    is spent on scipy's ``sum`` function which is needed to sum the number of
    void voxels (1's) in each subdomain.

    Also, this function is primed for parallelization since the ``npoints`` are
    calculated independenlty.

def radial_density(im, bins=10, voxel_size=1):
    r"""
    Computes radial density function by analyzing the histogram of voxel
    values in the distance transform.  This function is defined by
    Torquato [1] as:

        .. math::

            \int_0^\infty P(r)dr = 1.0

    where *P(r)dr* is the probability of finding a voxel at a lying at a radial
    distance between *r* and *dr* from the solid interface.

    The cumulative distribution is defined as:

        .. math::

            F(r) = \int_r^\infty P(r)dr

    which gives the fraction of pore-space with a radius larger than *r*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        Either a binary image of the pore space with ``True`` indicating the
        pore phase (or phase of interest), or a pre-calculated distance
        transform which can save time.

    bins : int or array_like
        This number of bins (if int) or the location of the bins (if array).
        This argument is passed directly to Scipy's ``histogram`` function so
        see that docstring for more information.  The default is 10 bins, which
        reduces produces a relatively smooth distribution.

    voxel_size : scalar
        The size of a voxel side in preferred units.  The default is 1, so the
        user can apply the scaling to the returned results after the fact.

    Returns
    -------
    A named-tuple containing several 1D arrays: ``R `` is the radius of the
    voxels (or x-axis of a pore-size density plot).  ``P`` is the radial
    density function, and ``F`` is the complementary cumulative distribution
    function.

    Notes
    -----
    This function should not be taken as a pore size distribution in the
    explict sense, but rather an indicator of the sizes in the image.  The
    distance transform contains a very skewed number of voxels with small
    values near the solid walls.  Nonetheless, it does provide a useful
    indicator and it's mathematical formalism is handy.

    Torquato refers to this as the pore-size density function, and mentions
    that it is also known as the pore-size distribution function.  These
    terms are avoided here since they have very specific connotations, and
    this function does not satisfy them.

    Calculates the porosity of an image assuming 1's are void space and 0's are
    solid phase.  All other values are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        Image of the void space with 1's indicating void space (or True) and
        0's indicating the solid phase (or False).

    Returns
    -------
    porosity : float

    This function assumes void is represented by 1 and solid by 0, and all
    other values are ignored.  This is useful, for example, for images of
    cylindrical cores, where all voxels outside the core are labelled with 2.

    Alternatively, images can be processed with ``find_disconnected_voxels``
    to get an image of only blind pores.  This can then be added to the orignal
    image such that blind pores have a value of 2, thus allowing the
    calculation of accessible porosity, rather than overall porosity.

    spacing : int
        The space between points on the regular grid that is used to generate
        the correlation (see Notes)

    Returns
    -------
    A tuple containing the x and y data for plotting the two-point correlation
    function, using the *args feature of matplotlib's plot function.  The x
    array is the distances between points and the y array is corresponding
    probabilities that points of a given distance both lie in the void space.

    The distance values are binned as follows:

        bins = range(start=0, stop=sp.amin(im.shape)/2, stride=spacing)

    Notes
    -----
    The brute-force approach means overlaying a grid of equally spaced points
    onto the image, calculating the distance between each and every pair of
    points, then counting the instances where both pairs lie in the void space.

    This approach uses a distance matrix so can consume memory very quickly for
    large 3D images and/or close spacing.
