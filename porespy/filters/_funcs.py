def apply_padded(im, pad_width, func, pad_val=1, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Applies padding to an image before sending to ``func``, then extracts
    the result corresponding to the original image shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        The image to which ``func`` should be applied
    pad_width : int or list of ints
        The amount of padding to apply to each axis. Refer to
        ``numpy.pad`` documentation for more details.
    pad_val : scalar
        The value to place into the padded voxels.  The default is 1 (or
        ``True``) which extends the pore space.
    func : function handle
        The function to apply to the padded image.
    kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments are collected and passed to ``func``.

    Notes

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        An image with the numerical values of interest in each voxel,
        and 0's elsewhere.
    labels : array_like
        An array the same shape as ``im`` with each region labeled.

            'minimum'
                Floods each region the local minimum in that region. The
                keyword ``min`` is also accepted.
            'median'
                Floods each region the local median in that region

                Floods each region the local mean in that region
            'size'
                Floods each region with the size of that region.  This is

        A 3D image of the porous material with void space marked as True.
    spacing : int (default = 0)
        Chords are automatically separed by 1 voxel on all sides, and this

def local_thickness(im, sizes=25, mode="hybrid", divs=1):
    r"""
    For each voxel, this function calculates the radius of the largest
    sphere that both engulfs the voxel and fits entirely within the
    foreground.

    This is not the same as a simple distance transform, which finds the
    largest sphere that could be *centered* on each voxel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        A binary image with the phase of interest set to True
    sizes : array_like or scalar
        The sizes to invade.  If a list of values of provided they are
        used directly. If a scalar is provided then that number of points
        spanning the min and max of the distance transform are used.
    mode : str
        Controls with method is used to compute the result. Options are:

        'hybrid'
            (default) Performs a distance transform of the void
            space, thresholds to find voxels larger than ``sizes[i]``, trims
            the resulting mask if ``access_limitations`` is ``True``, then
            dilates it using the efficient fft-method to obtain the
            non-wetting fluid configuration.
        'dt'
            Same as 'hybrid', except uses a second distance transform,
            relative to the thresholded mask, to find the invading fluid
            configuration. The choice of 'dt' or 'hybrid' depends on speed,
            which is system and installation specific.
        'mio'
            Using a single morphological image opening step to obtain
            the invading fluid confirguration directly, *then* trims if
            ``access_limitations`` is ``True``. This method is not ideal and
            is included for comparison purposes.

    divs : int or array_like
        The number of times to divide the image for parallel processing.  If ``1``
        then parallel processing does not occur.  ``2`` is equivalent to
        ``[2, 2, 2]`` for a 3D image.  The number of cores used is specified in
        ``porespy.settings.ncores`` and defaults to all cores.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ndarray
        A copy of ``im`` with the pore size values in each voxel.

    See Also
    --------
    porosimetry

    Notes
    -----
    The term *foreground* is used since this function can be applied to
    both pore space or the solid, whichever is set to ``True``.

    This function is identical to ``porosimetry`` with ``access_limited``
    set to ``False``.

    The way local thickness is found in PoreSpy differs from the
    traditional method (i.e. used in ImageJ
    `<https://imagej.net/Local_Thickness>`_). Our approach is probably
    slower, but it allows for the same code to be used for
    ``local_thickness`` and ``porosimetry``, since we can 'trim' invaded
    regions that are not connected to the inlets in the ``porosimetry``
    function. This is not needed in ``local_thickness`` however.

def porosimetry(im, sizes=25, inlets=None, access_limited=True, mode='hybrid',
                divs=1):
    r"""
    Performs a porosimetry simulution on an image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        An ND image of the porous material containing ``True`` values in the
        pore space.
    sizes : array_like or scalar
        The sizes to invade.  If a list of values of provided they are
        used directly.  If a scalar is provided then that number of points
        spanning the min and max of the distance transform are used.
    inlets : ndarray, boolean
        A boolean mask with ``True`` values indicating where the invasion
        enters the image.  By default all faces are considered inlets,
        akin to a mercury porosimetry experiment.  Users can also apply
        solid boundaries to their image externally before passing it in,
        allowing for complex inlets like circular openings, etc.
        This argument is only used if ``access_limited`` is ``True``.
    access_limited : bool
        This flag indicates if the intrusion should only occur from the
        surfaces (``access_limited`` is ``True``, which is the default),
        or if the invading phase should be allowed to appear in the core
        of the image.  The former simulates experimental tools like
        mercury intrusion porosimetry, while the latter is useful for
        comparison to gauge the extent of shielding effects in the sample.
    mode : str
        Controls with method is used to compute the result. Options are:

        'hybrid'
            (default) Performs a distance tranform of the void
            space, thresholds to find voxels larger than ``sizes[i]``,
            trims the resulting mask if ``access_limitations`` is ``True``,
            then dilates it using the efficient fft-method to obtain the
            non-wetting fluid configuration.
        'dt'
            Same as 'hybrid', except uses a second distance
            transform, relative to the thresholded mask, to find the
            invading fluid configuration. The choice of 'dt' or 'hybrid'
            depends on speed, which is system and installation specific.
        'mio'
            Uses bindary erosion followed by dilation to obtain the invading
            fluid confirguration directly. If ``access_limitations`` is
            ``True`` then disconnected blobs are trimmmed before the dilation.
            This is the only method that can be parallelized by chunking (see
            ``divs`` and ``cores``).

    divs : int or array_like
        The number of times to divide the image for parallel processing.  If ``1``
        then parallel processing does not occur.  ``2`` is equivalent to
        ``[2, 2, 2]`` for a 3D image.  The number of cores used is specified in
        ``porespy.settings.ncores`` and defaults to all cores.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ndarray
        A copy of ``im`` with voxel values indicating the sphere radius at
        which it becomes accessible from the inlets.  This image can be
        used to find invading fluid configurations as a function of
        applied capillary pressure by applying a boolean comparison:
        ``inv_phase = im > r`` where ``r`` is the radius (in voxels) of
        the invading sphere.  Of course, ``r`` can be converted to
        capillary pressure using a preferred model.

    Notes
    -----
    There are many ways to perform this filter, and PoreSpy offers 3,
    which users can choose between via the ``mode`` argument. These
    methods all work in a similar way by finding which foreground voxels
    can accomodate a sphere of a given radius, then repeating for smaller
    radii.

    r"""
    Performs the specfied operation "chunk-wise" in parallel using ``dask``.

    This can be used to save memory by doing one chunk at a time
    (``cores=1``) or to increase computation speed by spreading the work
    across multiple cores (e.g. ``cores=8``)

    This function can be used with any operation that applies a
    structuring element of some sort, since this implies that the
    operation is local and can be chunked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function handle
        The function which should be applied to each chunk, such as
        ``spipy.ndimage.binary_dilation``.
    overlap : scalar or list of scalars, optional
        The amount of overlap to include when dividing up the image. This
        value will almost always be the size (i.e. raduis) of the
        structuring element. If not specified then the amount of overlap
        is inferred from the size of the structuring element, in which
        case the ``strel_arg`` must be specified.
    divs : scalar or list of scalars (default = [2, 2, 2])
        The number of chunks to divide the image into in each direction.
        The default is 2 chunks in each direction, resulting in a
        quartering of the image and 8 total chunks (in 3D).  A scalar is
        interpreted as applying to all directions, while a list of scalars
        is interpreted as applying to each individual direction.
    cores : scalar
        The number of cores which should be used.  By default, all cores
        will be used, or as many are needed for the given number of
        chunks, which ever is smaller.
    im_arg : str
        The keyword used by ``func`` for the image to be operated on. By
        default this function will look for ``image``, ``input``, and
        ``im`` which are commonly used by *scipy.ndimage* and *skimage*.
    strel_arg : str
        The keyword used by ``func`` for the structuring element to apply.
        This is only needed if ``overlap`` is not specified. By default
        this function will look for ``strel``, ``structure``, and
        ``footprint`` which are commonly used by *scipy.ndimage* and
        *skimage*.
    kwargs
        All other arguments are passed to ``func`` as keyword arguments.
        Note that PoreSpy will fetch the image from this list of keywords
        using the value provided to ``im_arg``.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        An image the same size as the input image, with the specified
        filter applied as though done on a single large image. There
        should be *no* difference.

    Notes
    -----
    This function divides the image into the specified number of chunks,
    but also applies a padding to each chunk to create an overlap with
    neighboring chunks. This way the operation does not have any edge
    artifacts. The amount of padding is usually equal to the radius of the
    structuring element but some functions do not use one, such as the
    distance transform and Gaussian blur.  In these cases the user can
    specify ``overlap``.
