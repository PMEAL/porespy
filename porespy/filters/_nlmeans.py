def nl_means_layered(im, cores=None, axis=0, patch_size=5, patch_distance=15, h=4):
    r"""
    Apply the non-local means filter to each layer of a stack, in parallel.

    This applies ``skimage.restoration.denoise_nl_means`` to each slice, so refer
    to the documentation of that function for further information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        The greyscale image with noise to be removed
    cores : int (optional)
        The number of cores to use for the processing.  By default all available
        cores are used.
    axis : int
        The axis along which slices should be taken.  This should correspond to the
        axis of rotation of the tomography stage, so if the sample was rotated
        about the z-axis, then use ``axis=2``.
    patch_size : int
        Size of patches used for denoising
    patch_distance : ing
        Maximal distance in pixels where to search patches used for denoising.
    h : float
        Cut-off distance (in gray levels). The higher h, the more permissive one
        is in accepting patches. A higher h results in a smoother image, at the
        expense of blurring features. For a Gaussian noise of standard deviation
        sigma, a rule of thumb is to choose the value of h to be sigma of slightly
        less.

    Notes
    -----
    The quality of the result depends on ``patch_size``, ``patch_distance``, ``h``,
    and ``sigma``.  It is recommended to experiment with a single slice first until
    a suitable set of parameters is found.

    Each slice in the stack is adjusted to have the same histogram and intensity
