def snow_partitioning(im, dt=None, r_max=4, sigma=0.4, peaks=None):
    r"""
    Partition the void space into pore regions using a marker-based
    watershed algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        A boolean image of the domain, with ``True`` indicating the pore
        space and ``False`` elsewhere.
    dt : array_like, optional
        The distance transform of the pore space.  This is done
        automatically if not provided, but if the distance transform has
        already been computed then supplying it can save some time.
    r_max : int
        The radius of the spherical structuring element to use in the
        Maximum filter stage that is used to find peaks. The default is 4.
    sigma : float
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian filter used in step 1. The
        default is 0.4.  If 0 is given then the filter is not applied,
        which is useful if a distance transform is supplied as the ``im``
        argument that has already been processed.
    peaks : ndarray, optional
        Optionally, it is possible to supply an array containing peaks, which
        are used as markers in the watershed segmentation. If a boolean array
        is received (``True`` indicating peaks), then ``scipy.ndimage.label``
        with cubic connectivity is used to label them. If an integer array is
        received then it is assumed the peaks have already been labelled.
        This allows for comparison of peak finding algorithms for instance.
        If this argument is provided, then ``r_max`` and ``sigma`` are ignored
        since these are specfically used in the peak finding process.

    Returns

        ``im``       The binary image of the void space

    The SNOW network extraction algorithm (Sub-Network of an
    Over-segmented Watershed) was designed to handle to perculiarities of
    high porosity materials, but it applies well to other materials as
    well.

    Notes
    -----
    In principle it is possible to perform a distance transform on each
    phase separately, merge these into a single image, then apply the
    watershed only once. This, however, has been found to create edge
    artifacts between regions arising from the way watershed handles
    plateaus in the distance transform. To overcome this, this function
    applies the watershed to each of the distance transforms separately,
    then merges the segmented regions back into a single image.

def find_peaks(dt, r_max=4, strel=None, sigma=None, divs=1):
    r"""
    Finds local maxima in the distance transform

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : ndarray
        The distance transform of the pore space.  This may be calculated
        and filtered using any means desired.
    r_max : scalar
        The radius of the spherical element used in the maximum filter.
        This controls the localness of any maxima. The default is 4 voxels.
    strel : ndarray
        Instead of supplying ``r_max``, this argument allows a custom
        structuring element allowing control over both size and shape.
    sigma : float or list of floats
        If given, then a gaussian filter is applied to the distance transform
        using this value for the kernel
        (i.e. ``scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter(dt, sigma)``)
    divs : int or array_like
        The number of times to divide the image for parallel processing.
        If ``1`` then parallel processing does not occur.  ``2`` is
        equivalent to ``[2, 2, 2]`` for a 3D image. The number of cores
        used is specified in ``porespy.settings.ncores`` and defaults to
        all cores.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ndarray
        An array of booleans with ``True`` values at the location of any
        local maxima.

    Notes
    -----
    It is also possible ot the ``peak_local_max`` function from the
    ``skimage.feature`` module as follows:

    ``peaks = peak_local_max(image=dt, min_distance=r, exclude_border=0,
    indices=False)``

    The *skimage* function automatically uses a square structuring element
    which is significantly faster than using a circular or spherical
    element.

    r"""
    Performs SNOW algorithm in parallel (or serial) to reduce time
    (or memory usage) by geomertirc domain decomposition of large images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ndarray
        A binary image of porous media with 'True' values indicating
        phase of interest.
    overlap : float (optional)
        The amount of overlap to apply between chunks.  If not provided it
        will be estiamted using ``porespy.tools.estimate_overlap`` with
        ``mode='dt'``.
    divs : list or int
        Number of domains each axis will be divided. Options are:
          - scalar: it will be assigned to all axis.
          - list: each respective axis will be divided by its
            corresponding number in the list. For example [2, 3, 4] will
            divide z, y and x axis to 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
    cores : int or None
        Number of cores that will be used to parallel process all domains.
        If ``None`` then all cores will be used but user can specify any
        integer values to control the memory usage.  Setting value to 1
        will effectively process the chunks in serial to minimize memory
        usage.

    regions : ndarray
        Partitioned image of segmentated regions with unique labels. Each
        region correspond to pore body while intersection with other
        region correspond throat area.
