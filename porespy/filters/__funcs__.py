def snow_partitioning(im, r_max=4, sigma=0.4, return_all=False):
    r"""
    This function partitions the void space into pore regions using a
    marker-based watershed algorithm.  The key to this function is that true
    local maximum of the distance transform are found by trimming various
    types of extraneous peaks.

    The SNOW network extraction algorithm (Sub-Network of an Over-segmented
    Watershed) was designed to handle to perculiarities of high porosity
    materials, but it applies well to other materials as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        Can be either (a) a boolean image of the domain, with ``True``
        indicating the pore space and ``False`` elsewhere, or (b) a distance
        transform of the domain calculated externally by the user.  Option (b)
        is faster if a distance transform is already available.

    r_max : scalar
        The radius of there spherical structuring element to use in the Maximum
        filter stage that is used to find peaks.  The default is 4

    sigma : scalar
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian filter used in step 1.  The
        default is 0.4.  If 0 is given then the filter is not applied, which is
        useful if a distance transform is supplied as the ``im`` argument that
        has already been processed.

    return_all : boolean (default is False)
        If set to ``True`` a named tuple is returned containing the original
        image, the distance transform, the filtered peaks, and the final
        pore regions.

    Returns
    -------
    An image the same shape as ``im`` with the void space partitioned into
    pores using a marker based watershed with the peaks found by the
    SNOW algorithm [1].  If ``return_all`` is ``True`` then a **named tuple**
    is returned with the following attribute:

        * ``im``: The binary image of the void space
        * ``dt``: The distance transform of the image
        * ``peaks``: The peaks of the distance transform after applying the
        steps of the SNOW algorithm
        * ``regions``: The void space partitioned into pores using a marker
        based watershed with the peaks found by the SNOW algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------

        The distance transform of the pore space.  This may be calculated and
        filtered using any means desired.

    r : scalar
        The size of the structuring element used in the maximum filter.  This

    footprint : ND-array
        Specifies the shape of the structuring element used to define the
        neighborhood when looking for peaks.  If none is specified then a
        spherical shape is used (or circular in 2D).

    Returns
    -------

def find_dt_artifacts(dt):

    Finds points in a distance transform that are closer to wall than solid.

    These points could *potentially* be erroneously high since their distance
    values do not reflect the possibility that solid may have been present
    beyond the border of the image but lost by trimming.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : ND-array
        The distance transform of the phase of interest

    Returns
    -------
    An ND-array the same shape as ``dt`` with numerical values indicating
    the maximum amount of error in each volxel, which is found by subtracting
    the distance to nearest edge of image from the distance transform value.
    In other words, this is the error that would be found if there were a solid
    voxel lurking just beyond the nearest edge of the image.  Obviously,
    voxels with a value of zero have no error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        An image of the porous material with void marked as ``True``.

    spacing : int
        Separation between chords.  The default is 1 voxel.  This can be
        decreased to 0, meaning that the chords all touch each other, which
        automatically sets to the ``label`` argument to ``True``.

    axis : int (default = 0)
        The axis along which the chords are drawn.

    trim_edges : bool (default = True)
        Whether or not to remove chords that touch the edges of the image.
        These chords are artifically shortened, so skew the chord length
        distribution.

    label : bool
        If ``True`` the chords in the returned image are each given a unique
        label, such that all voxels lying on the same chord have the same
        value.  This is automatically set to ``True`` if spacing is 0, but is
        ``False`` otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        A 3D image of the porous material with void space marked as True.

    spacing : int (default = 0)
        Chords are automatically separed by 1 voxel on all sides, and this

    Notes
    -----

    For each voxel, this functions calculates the radius of the largest sphere
    that both engulfs the voxel and fits entirely within the foreground. This
    is not the same as a simple distance transform, which finds the largest
    sphere that could be *centered* on each voxel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        A binary image with the phase of interest set to True

    sizes : array_like or scalar
        The sizes to invade.  If a list of values of provided they are used

    -------
    An image with the pore size values in each voxel

    Notes
    -----

    Performs a porosimetry simulution on the image

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        An ND image of the porous material containing True values in the
        pore space.

    sizes : array_like or scalar
        The sizes to invade.  If a list of values of provided they are used
        directly.  If a scalar is provided then that number of points spanning
        the min and max of the distance transform are used.

    inlets : ND-array, boolean
        A boolean mask with True values indicating where the invasion
        enters the image.  By default all faces are considered inlets,
        akin to a mercury porosimetry experiment.  Users can also apply
        solid boundaries to their image externally before passing it in,
        allowing for complex inlets like circular openings, etc.  This argument
        is only used if ``access_limited`` is ``True``.

    access_limited : Boolean
        This flag indicates if the intrusion should only occur from the
        surfaces (``access_limited`` is True, which is the default), or
        if the invading phase should be allowed to appear in the core of
        the image.  The former simulates experimental tools like mercury
        intrusion porosimetry, while the latter is useful for comparison
        to gauge the extent of shielding effects in the sample.

    mode : string
        Controls with method is used to compute the result.  Options are:

        *'fft'* - (default) Performs a distance tranform of the void space,
        thresholds to find voxels larger than ``sizes[i]``, trims the resulting
        mask if ``access_limitations`` is ``True``, then dilates it using the
        efficient fft-method to obtain the non-wetting fluid configuration.

        *'dt'* - Same as 'fft', except uses a second distance transform,
        relative to the thresholded mask, to find the invading fluid
        configuration.  The choice of 'dt' or 'fft' depends on speed, which
        is system and installation specific.

        *'mio'* - Using a single morphological image opening step to obtain the
        invading fluid confirguration directly, *then* trims if
        ``access_limitations`` is ``True``.  This method is not ideal and is
        included mostly for comparison purposes.

    Returns
    -------
    An ND-image with voxel values indicating the sphere radius at which it
    becomes accessible from the inlets.  This image can be used to find
    invading fluid configurations as a function of applied capillary pressure
    by applying a boolean comparison: ``inv_phase = im > r`` where ``r`` is
    the radius (in voxels) of the invading sphere.  Of course, ``r`` can be
    converted to capillary pressure using your favorite model.
