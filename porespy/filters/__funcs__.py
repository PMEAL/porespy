    Partitions the void space into pore regions using a marker-based watershed
    algorithm, with specially filtered peaks as markers.

    The SNOW network extraction algorithm (Sub-Network of an Over-segmented
    Watershed) was designed to handle to perculiarities of high porosity
    materials, but it applies well to other materials as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        A boolean image of the domain, with ``True`` indicating the pore space
        and ``False`` elsewhere.
    dt : array_like, optional
        The distance transform of the pore space.  This is done automatically
        if not provided, but if the distance transform has already been
        computed then supplying it can save some time.
    r_max : int
        The radius of the spherical structuring element to use in the Maximum
        filter stage that is used to find peaks.  The default is 4
    sigma : float
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian filter used in step 1.  The
        default is 0.4.  If 0 is given then the filter is not applied, which is
        useful if a distance transform is supplied as the ``im`` argument that
        has already been processed.
    return_all : boolean
        If set to ``True`` a named tuple is returned containing the original
        image, the distance transform, the filtered peaks, and the final
        pore regions.  The default is ``False``
    mask : boolean
        Apply a mask to the regions where the solid phase is.  Default is
        ``True``
    randomize : boolean
        If ``True`` (default), then the region colors will be randomized before
        returning.  This is helpful for visualizing otherwise neighboring
        regions have simlar coloring are are hard to distinguish.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ND-array
        An image the same shape as ``im`` with the void space partitioned into
        pores using a marker based watershed with the peaks found by the
        SNOW algorithm [1].

    Notes
    -----
    If ``return_all`` is ``True`` then a **named tuple** is returned containing
    all of the images used during the process.  They can be access as
    attriutes with the following names:

        * ``im``: The binary image of the void space
        * ``dt``: The distance transform of the image

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        Image of porous material where each phase is represented by unique
        integer starting from 1 (0's are ignored).
    r_max : scalar

    mask : boolean (default is True)
        Apply a mask to the regions which are not under concern.
    randomize : boolean
        If ``True`` (default), then the region colors will be randomized before
        returning.  This is helpful for visualizing otherwise neighboring
        regions have similar coloring and are hard to distinguish.
    alias : dict (Optional)
        A dictionary that assigns unique image label to specific phases. For
        example {1: 'Solid'} will show all structural properties associated
        with label 1 as Solid phase properties. If ``None`` then default

    Returns
    -------
    An image the same shape as ``im`` with the all phases partitioned into
    regions using a marker based watershed with the peaks found by the
    SNOW algorithm [1].  If ``return_all`` is ``True`` then a **named tuple**

        * ``im`` : The actual image of the porous material
        * ``dt`` : The combined distance transform of the image

        distinguish between each other

        based watershed with the peaks found by the SNOW algorithm

    Notes
    -----
    In principle it is possible to perform a distance transform on each
    phase separately, merge these into a single image, then apply the
    watershed only once. This, however, has been found to create edge artifacts
    between regions arising from the way watershed handles plateaus in the
    distance transform. To overcome this, this function applies the watershed
    to each of the distance transforms separately, then merges the segmented
    regions back into a single image.

    each pair is considered.  This ensures that only the single peak that is
    furthest from the solid is kept.  No iteration is required.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : array_like
        A binary image with the phase of interest set to True

    sizes : array_like or scalar
        The sizes to invade.  If a list of values of provided they are used

        the min and max of the distance transform are used.

    mode : string
        Controls with method is used to compute the result.  Options are:

        'hybrid' - (default) Performs a distance tranform of the void space,
        thresholds to find voxels larger than ``sizes[i]``, trims the resulting
        mask if ``access_limitations`` is ``True``, then dilates it using the
        efficient fft-method to obtain the non-wetting fluid configuration.

        'dt' - Same as 'hybrid', except uses a second distance transform,
        relative to the thresholded mask, to find the invading fluid
        configuration.  The choice of 'dt' or 'hybrid' depends on speed, which
        is system and installation specific.

        'mio' - Using a single morphological image opening step to obtain the
        invading fluid confirguration directly, *then* trims if
        ``access_limitations`` is ``True``.  This method is not ideal and is
        included mostly for comparison purposes.

    The way local thickness is found in PoreSpy differs from the traditional
    method (i.e. `used in ImageJ <https://imagej.net/Local_Thickness>`_).
    Our approach is probably slower, but it allows for the same code to be
    used for ``local_thickness`` and ``porosimetry``, since we can 'trim'
    invaded regions that are not connected to the inlets in the ``porosimetry``
    function.  This is not needed in ``local_thickness`` however.

    Parameters
    ----------
    im : ND-array
        An ND image of the porous material containing True values in the

    sizes : array_like or scalar
        The sizes to invade.  If a list of values of provided they are used

        the min and max of the distance transform are used.

    inlets : ND-array, boolean
        A boolean mask with True values indicating where the invasion
        enters the image.  By default all faces are considered inlets,
        akin to a mercury porosimetry experiment.  Users can also apply
        solid boundaries to their image externally before passing it in,
        allowing for complex inlets like circular openings, etc.  This argument
        is only used if ``access_limited`` is ``True``.

    access_limited : Boolean
        This flag indicates if the intrusion should only occur from the
        surfaces (``access_limited`` is True, which is the default), or
        if the invading phase should be allowed to appear in the core of
        the image.  The former simulates experimental tools like mercury
        intrusion porosimetry, while the latter is useful for comparison
        to gauge the extent of shielding effects in the sample.

        'dt' - Same as 'hybrid', except uses a second distance transform,
        relative to the thresholded mask, to find the invading fluid
        configuration.  The choice of 'dt' or 'hybrid' depends on speed, which
        is system and installation specific.

        'mio' - Using a single morphological image opening step to obtain the
        invading fluid confirguration directly, *then* trims if
        ``access_limitations`` is ``True``.  This method is not ideal and is
        included mostly for comparison purposes.  The morphological operations
        are done using fft-based method implementations.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ND-array
        A copy of ``im`` with voxel values indicating the sphere radius at
        which it becomes accessible from the inlets.  This image can be used
        to find invading fluid configurations as a function of applied
        capillary pressure by applying a boolean comparison:
        ``inv_phase = im > r`` where ``r`` is the radius (in voxels) of the
        invading sphere.  Of course, ``r`` can be converted to capillary
        pressure using your favorite model.

    Notes
    -----
    There are many ways to perform this filter, and PoreSpy offers 3, which
    users can choose between via the ``mode`` argument.  These methods all
    work in a similar way by finding which foreground voxels can accomodate
    a sphere of a given radius, then repeating for smaller radii.
