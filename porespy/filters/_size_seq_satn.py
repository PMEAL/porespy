def size_to_seq(size, im=None, bins=None):
    r"""
    Converts an image of invasion size values into sequence values

    This is meant to accept the output of the ``porosimetry`` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : ndarray
        The image containing invasion size values in each voxel.
    im : ndarray, optional
        A binary image of the porous media, with ``True`` indicating the
        void space and ``False`` indicating the solid phase. If not given
        then it is assumed that the solid is identified as ``size == 0``.
    bins : array_like or int (optional)
        The bins to use when converting sizes to sequence.  The default is
        to create 1 bin for each unique value in ``size``.  If an **int**
        is supplied it is interpreted as the number of bins between 0 and the
        maximum value in ``size``.  If an array is supplied it is used as
        the bins directly.

    Returns
    -------
    seq : ndarray
        An ndarray the same shape as ``size`` with invasion size values
        replaced by the invasion sequence.  This assumes that the invasion
        process occurs via increasing pressure steps, such as produced by
        the ``porosimetry`` function.

def size_to_satn(size, im=None, bins=None):
    r"""
    Converts an image of invasion size values into saturations.

    This is meant to accept the output of the ``porosimetry`` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : ndarray
        The image containing invasion size values in each voxel.
    im : ndarray, optional
        A binary image of the porous media, with ``True`` indicating the
        void space and ``False`` indicating the solid phase. If not given
        then it is assumed that the solid is identified as ``size == 0``.
    bins : array_like or int (optional)
        The bins to use when converting sizes to saturation.  The default is
        to create 1 bin for each unique value in ``size``.  If an **int**
        is supplied it is interpreted as the number of bins between 0 and the
        maximum value in ``size``.  If an array is supplied it is used as
        the bins directly.

    Returns
    -------
    satn : ndarray
        An ndarray the same size as ``seq`` but with sequence values replaced
        by the fraction of void space invaded at or below the sequence number.
        Solid voxels and uninvaded voxels are represented by 0 and -1,
        respectively.

def seq_to_satn(seq, im=None):
    r"""
    Converts an image of invasion sequence values to saturation values.

    This is meant to accept the output of the ``ibip`` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : ndarray
        The image containing invasion sequence values in each voxel.  Solid
        should be indicated as 0's and uninvaded voxels as -1.
    im : ndarray, optional
        A binary image of the porous media, with ``True`` indicating the
        void space and ``False`` indicating the solid phase. If not given
